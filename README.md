# AmiiboComplexApi
In this project im accessing a Nintendo API so i can pull characters and show their amiibo or card IMGs during the process i am accessing another API that guesses if the Amiibo name is male or female. So an example would be if I type in Mario a IMG pops up and a text where it says Male.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, two API's

# Lessons Learned:
I learn how to use Api's and how to get them to work with one another!
